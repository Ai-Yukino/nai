# `README.md` for [nai repo](https://github.com/Ai-Yukino/nai)

A night mode LaTeX style presets similar to how my [yukino.ai](http://yukino.ai/) currently looks

---

## ❄ Usage

Import `nai.tex` in the header of your main `.tex` file, e.g.

```
\input{nai.tex}
```

If you're combining this theme with your own style presets or other tex templates (e.g. maybe `.sty` files for resumes), then things may conflict. I have not tested these presets in those cases, but please let me know if you have any issues!
